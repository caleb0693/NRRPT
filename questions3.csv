Which of the following radionuclides cannot be detected by gamma spectrometry pulse height analysis?,Hydrogen-3,Iodine-131,Cerium-144,Ruthenium-106,Cesium-137,0,"Hydrogen-3 (tritium) is a pure beta (β-) emitter with a half-life of 12.3 years and a maximum energy of 18.6 keV.  Beta particles have an average energy of about one third of their maximum energy, in this case 6.2 keV. The only way to detect hydrogen-3 is to swipe (100 cm2  for surveys and 300 cm2  for transportation) and count in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC).",

Which of the following radionuclides is most suited to in-vivo measurements?,Hydrogen-3,Carbon-14,Strontium-90,Iodine-131,Plutonium-239,3,"“in vivo” means “performed or taking place in a living organism.” As weak pure beta (β-) emitters, hydrogen-3 and carbon-14 can only be seen through liquid scintillation analysis of urine (outside of the body).  Strontinum-90 is also a pure beta emitter (fecal-analysis or urinalysis).
Plutonium-239 has a very weak x-ray which is shielded by the body (lung lavage has been used in the past).  Iodine-131 (a mixed β-/γ emitter) can be seen with a sodium-iodine probe held to the body (usually measuring on the thyroid).",
